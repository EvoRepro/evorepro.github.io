		  <p>Related organisms are similar due to comparable genomic inventories. Recent advances in 
		  comparative transcriptomics have shown that these similarities are also reflected in conserved 
		  expression profiles of genes, which can be seen in highly similar transcriptional 
		  co-regulation (co-expression) networks 
		  (<a href='http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02517.x/full'>Movahedi <em>et al</em>., 2012</a>).
		   </p>
		   <p>
		   Here expression data (publicly available and data generated by EvoRepro members) will be used to generate such co-expression networks in various species.
		   (<a href='http://www.plantcell.org/content/23/3/895.long'>Mutwil <em>et al</em>., 2011</a>). 
		   Furthermore <a href='http://www.gene2function.de'>PlaNet</a>, an online browser for gene expression profiles and co-expression networks,
		   will be extended to study gene expression,
		   co-expression networks and their conservation across species along with functional annotation.
		   This will allow identification of conserved gene sets relevant for gamete development in lower 
		   and higher plants.</p>
