                    <hr class="primary">
		  <p>The origin and functional conservation of key male germline regulators is being investigated, together with the role(s)
		  of novel network components identified through phylotranscriptomic analysis. The work is focused on the MYB transcription 
		  factor DUO1, which regulates germ cell division and sperm differentiation in Arabidopsis (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205000394?via%3Dihub">Rotman et al, 2005</a>; <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000430">Brownfield et al, 2009</a>), 
		  and the DAZ1 class of zinc finger proteins, which form a downstream regulatory node in the DUO1-DAZ1 network 
		  (<a href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=21285328">Borg et al, 2011</a>; <a href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=24876252">Borg et al, 2014</a>).
		   </p>
		   <p>
		   The expression and functions of DUO1 and DAZ1 orthologues from several angiosperms (maize, rice, tomato, Amborella) are 
		   being explored through transcriptome analysis, trans-activation assays and by complementation of Arabidopsis mutants. 
		   To gain deeper insight into DUO1-DAZ1 network evolution in angiosperms, the tomato orthologues of DUO1 and DAZ1 are 
		   being targeted for knockout by genome editing.</p>
		   <p>To uncover network conservation in pre-angiosperms, knockouts of DUO1 and DAZ1 orthologues are being studied in 
		   the Bryophyte models, <em>Physcomitrella patens</em> and <em>Marchantia polymorpha</em>, together with their expression and activities
		   in functional complementation assays. The deeper evolutionary origins of the DUO1-DAZ1 network is being explored through 
		   transcriptome studies and functional assays of ancestral sequences present in the Streptophyte ancestors of land plants. </p>
